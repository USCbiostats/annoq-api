PrimateAI_score	A pathogenicity prediction score for missense variants based on common variants of	non-human primate species using a deep neural network. The range of PrimateAI score is 0 to 1. The larger the score, the more likely the variant is pathogenic. The authors suggest a threshold of 0.803 for separating damaging vs tolerant variants. Details see https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0167-z	The larger the score, the more likely the variant is pathogenic. The authors suggest a threshold	of 0.803 for separating damaging vs tolerant variants.	Details see https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0167-z
PrimateAI_rankscore	PrimateAI scores were ranked among all PrimateAI scores in dbNSFP. The rankscore is	the ratio of the rank of the score over the total number of PrimateAI scores in dbNSFP.
PrimateAI_pred	Prediction of PrimateAI score based on the authors' recommendation, "T(olerated)" or	"D(amaging)". The score cutoff between "D" and "T" is 0.803.
DEOGEN2_score	A deleteriousness prediction score "which incorporates heterogeneous information about	the molecular effects of the variants, the domains involved, the relevance of the gene and the interactions in which it participates". It ranges from 0 to 1. The larger the score, the more likely the variant is deleterious. The authors suggest a threshold of 0.5 for separating damaging vs tolerant variants.	interactions in which it participates". It ranges from 0 to 1. The larger the score, the more	likely the variant is deleterious. The authors suggest a threshold of 0.5 for separating damaging	vs tolerant variants.
DEOGEN2_rankscore	DEOGEN2 scores were ranked among all DEOGEN2 scores in dbNSFP. The rankscore is	the ratio of the rank of the score over the total number of DEOGEN2 scores in dbNSFP.
DEOGEN2_pred	Prediction of DEOGEN2 score based on the authors' recommendation, "T(olerated)" or	"D(amaging)". The score cutoff between "D" and "T" is 0.5.
